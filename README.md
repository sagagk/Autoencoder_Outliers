# Autoencoder_Outliers
This is a basic demo of a tested architecture from the article "Detection of atypical vehicle trajectories using deep autoencoders in Santiago, Chile"

1. Data sets
Due to the private nature of the data sets, we only share a small anonymized sample of the data set to test the neural network code.

This anonymized data set can be obtained from:

2. Code
The main code is Demo_SAutoencoder_conv.ipynb which shows the training of a convolutional architecture tested in paper. 
The dense alternative should be easily implemented.
